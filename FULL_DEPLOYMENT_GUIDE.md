**Best for educational institutions:**
1. Sign up at [pythonanywhere.com](https://pythonanywhere.com)
2. Upload your code via Git or zip
3. Create a web app in the Web tab
4. Set up virtual environment and install from `requirements-full.txt`
5. Configure WSGI file to point to `production_app.py`

## 🔧 Environment Variables Needed

**Essential Variables:**
- `SECRET_KEY`: Secure random string (generate with `python -c "import secrets; print(secrets.token_hex(32))"`)
- `DATABASE_URL`: PostgreSQL connection string (auto-provided by platforms)
- `FLASK_ENV`: Set to "production"

**Optional Variables:**
- `MAIL_SERVER`: For email functionality
- `MAIL_USERNAME`: Email username
- `MAIL_PASSWORD`: Email password

## 📋 Post-Deployment Checklist

After deployment, verify these features work:

### Student Features ✅
- [ ] Student registration and login

- [ ] Subject enrollment
- [ ] Performance data entry (grades, attendance, study hours)
- [ ] **ML-powered score predictions** 🤖
- [ ] Performance analytics and charts

### Faculty Features ✅
- [ ] Faculty registration and login
- [ ] Student management dashboard
- [ ] Subject management
- [ ] Individual student performance analysis
- [ ] **Overall analytics with ML insights** 📊
- [ ] Data export functionality

### ML Model Features ✅
- [ ] Synthetic data initialization

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

**Common Issues & Solutions:**

1. **ML Dependencies Fail to Install**
   - Solution: Use Railway or Render (better ML support)
   - Alternative: Reduce to essential ML packages only

2. **Database Errors**
   - Ensure PostgreSQL is configured
   - Check DATABASE_URL environment variable
   - Run database migrations if needed

3. **Memory Issues**
   - ML models can be memory-intensive
   - Consider using lighter ML algorithms
   - Optimize data loading

4. **Build Timeout**
   - Split requirements into essential/optional
   - Use pre-built wheels when available
   - Increase build timeout limits

## 🎯 Recommended: Railway Deployment

Railway is the best option because:
- ✅ **Native ML Support**: No issues with scikit-learn, pandas, numpy
- ✅ **Free Tier**: $5/month credit (plenty for development)
- ✅ **Auto Database**: PostgreSQL included
- ✅ **Zero Config**: Works with your existing `railway.toml`
- ✅ **Fast Builds**: Optimized for Python ML apps

## 🚀 Quick Railway Deployment

1. **Push Latest Code:**
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Add full ML deployment configuration"
   git push origin master
   ```

2. **Deploy to Railway:**
   - Visit [railway.app](https://railway.app)
   - Click "Deploy from GitHub repo"
   - Select `FlixBlackout/STA`
   - Railway automatically detects `railway.toml`
   - Wait 3-5 minutes for build completion
   - Your app will be live with full ML capabilities! 🎉
